This project is work in progress. 

To Run:
./DepthMapToPtCloud images/depthImage131107_182133.none.tiff

TODO: display the point cloud data in PCL visualizer for debugging

NOTES:

The energid image is LZW compressed. It needs to be either "deflate" compressed or no compression. The fix for now is converting the image to no compression:

convert -compress none depthImage131107_182133.tiff depthImage131107_182133.none.tiff
